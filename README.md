Features:
* timer starts in first mission of any campaign
* auto splits on mission change
* Load time removal (loads, menu and game exit time)
* Glitched runs support (quicksave/quickload/game restart)

Known issues:
* Sometimes (very rare) on game exit in Glitched category timer will split twice for some reason. Still working on fixing that cause its hard to track and never happened when i tested it on purpose.
